        <h2>Official Contract</h2>
        <p>This is a legally binding agreement between us. You are hereby agreeing to the following terms:</p>
        <p><strong>
            <br>
            Duration of Relationship: This agreement shall remain in full force and effect until death do us part, or until we agree to change the terms (for example, adding more fun dates or adventures).
            <br><br>
            Mutual Obligations:
            Party 1 agrees to always be there for Party 2, offering support, understanding, and an occasional cheesy pick-up line.
            Party 2 agrees to laugh at Party 1â€™s jokes, even when theyâ€™re not that funny.
            Both parties agree to share spontaneous moments of joy, whether it's through playing video games, sharing music, or staying up late talking about life.
            <br><br>
            Commitment to Growth: Both parties agree to help each other grow emotionally, intellectually, and creatively. This includes supporting dreams, offering advice, and occasionally indulging in a good movie.
            <br><br>
            The Power of Quotes: Both parties agree to share and cherish quotes, as they have become an essential part of the relationship. Each party will contribute at least one new quote per month to inspire the other.
            <br><br>
            Proximity Clause: This agreement also includes an obligation for occasional spontaneous kisses.</strong></p>

        <p>Your signature (type your name below) is required to confirm your commitment:</p>

        <input type="text" class="signature-input" placeholder="Your Full Name" id="signature" required>

        <br><br>

        <button class="submit-button" onclick="submitContract()">Sign the Contract</button>
    </div>
